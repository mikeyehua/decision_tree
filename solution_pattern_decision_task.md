# Solution Pattern Decision Task

This is a guide on how to match a use case to a solution pattern. You need to start from [Starting Point](#starting-point-identified-Archetype)

## Starting Point: Identified Archetype

You need to check, for current use case, whether an Out of Box Solution is preferred and available or not.

1. **Out of Box Solution is acceptable**: Go to [Node 1](#node-1).
2. **Out of Box Solution is not acceptable**: Go to [Node 2](#node-2).

---

## Node 1: 

At this point, you need to check whether the use case requires specific domain knowledge or not.

1. **Domain Knowledge is required**: Go to [Node 3](#node-3).
2. **Domain Knowledge is not required**: Go to [Pattern 1](#pattern-1).

---

## Node 2: 

At this point, you need to check whether the use case requires specific domain knowledge or not.

1. **Domain Knowledge is required**: Go to [Node 4](#node-4).
2. **Domain Knowledge is not required**: Go to [Node 5](#node-5).

---

## Node 3: 

At this point, you need to check whether the data of current use case can be used by MaaS or not.

1. **Data can be used by MaaS**: Go to [Pattern 2](#pattern-2).
2. **Data cannot be used by MaaS**: Go to [Pattern 7](#pattern-7).

---

## Node 4: 

At this point, you need to check whether the data of current use case can be used by MaaS or not.

1. **Data can be used by MaaS**: Go to [Node 6](#node-6).
2. **Data cannot be used by MaaS**: Go to [Pattern 5](#pattern-5).

---

## Node 5: 

At this point, you need to check whether the data of current use case can be used by MaaS or not.

1. **Data can be used by MaaS**: Go to [Node 7](#node-7).
2. **Data cannot be used by MaaS**: Go to [Pattern 5](#pattern-5).

---

## Node 6: 

At this point, you need to check whether single model works or not.

1. **Single model works**: Go to [Pattern 4](#pattern-4).
2. **Single model cannot work**: Go to [Pattern 6](#pattern-6).

---

## Node 7: 

At this point, you need to check whether single model works or not.

1. **Single model works**: Go to [Pattern 3](#pattern-3).
2. **Single model cannot work**: Go to [Pattern 6](#pattern-6).

---

## Pattern 1: 

Your final choice is Pattern 1

---

## Pattern 2: 

Your final choice is Pattern 2

---

## Pattern 3: 

Your final choice is Pattern 3

---

## Pattern 4: 

Your final choice is Pattern 4

---

## Pattern 5: 

Your final choice is Pattern 5

---

## Pattern 6: 

Your final choice is Pattern 6

---

## Pattern 7: 

Your final choice is Pattern 7
